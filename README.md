# Gaheris Mojo Script
## Intro
This is a script that should be use with Mojo for Daoc (Dark Age of Camelot).
I made different teams using this script like : 
- 3 pbae, 1 paladin/valk, 1 shaman, 1 bard
- 3 savage, 1 paladin, 1 shaman, 1 bard
- 3 theurgist, 1paladin/valk, healer, shaman

## Guide
Explore the different folders, and you just need to copy/past the part of "sample-ui" that interest you in "ui-configuration-example.txt"

Then in mojo, just provide the "ui-configuration-example.txt" for your hotkeys file.

You might update "controller.txt" to make sure the buttons will work (spell, style, buff, heal etc.)
